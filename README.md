# CREARAY - Artist Portfolio Website
**Website tagline**
Ideas may scatter, but the final picture always comes together

# Purpose of the Website
The main purpose of this website is to serve as an online portfolio that promotes the different works and creative projects the artist has created. In addition to functioning as a portfolio, it will also serve as a professional website for potential clients, providing a centralized and accessible platform where they can view the artist’s showcase of previous works such as character design, 3D modeling, and more. By presenting the artworks in an organized and visually appealing manner, the website also aims to strengthen the artist’s brand identity and expand their reach to a wider audience.
